Elaborated Scenario-Based Challenge: Library Management System
Background
You are designing a Java-based library management system for "LibraTech", a modern library with an extensive collection of books. The system needs to efficiently manage books, categorized by unique ISBN numbers, and support various functionalities for both staff and visitors.

Key Requirements
Efficient Book Look-up: Quickly check if a book is available in the library.
Chronological Display of Books: Display books based on the order of their acquisition.
Organized Book Sorting: Sort books numerically by ISBN for cataloging and referencing.
Duplicate Management: Ensure no duplicate books are added to the collection.
Data Structure Choices
HashSet: Offers fast look-up but doesn't maintain any order.
LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order and offers reasonably fast look-up.
TreeSet: Keeps elements sorted and provides ordered retrieval.
Scenario-Based Challenges
User Search Functionality:

Scenario: A user wants to search for a book by its ISBN.
Challenge: Choose the most suitable Set implementation for this function and explain your choice.
New Arrivals Section:

Scenario: The library showcases new arrivals on its website in the order they were added.
Challenge: Determine the best Set type to use and justify your decision.
Cataloging System:

Scenario: Librarians need to periodically create a sorted list of books for inventory and auditing.
Challenge: Select the appropriate Set implementation for this task and explain its advantages.
Duplicate ISBN Check:

Scenario: When new books are added to the system, it's critical to ensure that no duplicate ISBNs exist.
Challenge: Discuss how each Set type handles duplicates and recommend the best option for this requirement.
Advanced Sorting:

Scenario: For a special archival project, books need to be listed in reverse order of their ISBNs.
Challenge: Suggest a modification or a different approach to meet this requirement using the available Set types.


Reference :
User Search Functionality:

Scenario: Searching for a book by its ISBN.
Solution: Use a HashSet.
Rationale: HashSet offers the fastest lookup time (average O(1) complexity) for checking if an element exists, which is ideal for searching books by ISBN.
New Arrivals Section:

Scenario: Displaying new arrivals in the order they were added.
Solution: Use a LinkedHashSet.
Rationale: LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of elements. It’s a bit slower than HashSet for addition and lookup (still O(1) on average), but it’s the best choice for maintaining and displaying the order of new arrivals.
Cataloging System:

Scenario: Creating a sorted list of books for inventory and auditing.
Solution: Use a TreeSet.
Rationale: TreeSet automatically sorts the elements (books by their ISBN in this case). It has higher time complexity for additions and lookups (O(log n)) compared to HashSet and LinkedHashSet, but its ability to keep the books sorted is crucial for this task.
Duplicate ISBN Check:

Scenario: Ensuring no duplicate ISBNs when adding new books.
Solution: Any of HashSet, LinkedHashSet, or TreeSet.
Rationale: All these implementations of the Set interface in Java inherently prevent duplicates. However, given the specific requirements of other functionalities (fast lookup, order maintenance, or sorting), the choice would depend on which additional functionality is deemed more critical.
Advanced Sorting:

Scenario: Listing books in reverse order of their ISBNs.
Solution: Use TreeSet with a custom Comparator.
Rationale: TreeSet can be customized with a Comparator to define the order of elements. By providing a Comparator that sorts ISBNs in reverse order, you can meet this requirement. This approach retains the sorting and uniqueness properties of TreeSet while allowing for customized ordering.
